## how to choose a good problem

_Can do it with others_

- read a lot of papers, access them, and discuss them with others

- work with other people who work on similar topics. Learn from them

- seek advice from experienced researchers. Ideas are cheap, how well your execution is is more important.

_Do it by yourself_

- spend time thinking on what research is useful and fruitful

	- when is theory useful?
	- when are empirical results transferable?
	- what causes some ideas to get wide uptake, whereas others are forgotten?
	- what are the trands in your field? which lines of work will make the other ones obsolete?

## Idea-driven vs goal-driven research

__Goal-Driven: Develop a vision of some new AI capabilities you'd like to achieve__, e.g. if you want to build curiosity in robots (goal), break it into multiple sub-goals and achieve it one-by-one. You can track you progresses in this way. 

__Idea-Driven: Paper 1 shows idea 1. You come up with a better idea 2 and embark on a project to test idea 2.__

__Problem-Driven: There is a real-world robotics problem and you should come up with a solution to solve it.__


- use problem-driven method to find a good and important problem

- use goal-driven (most of the time) and idea-driven method to build up your work incrementally towards great results

## Keep a note of your progress

- keep an entry for each day, entry list includes

	- what I am doing; 

	- ideas; 

	- experimental results;

- Every 1 or 2 weeks, do a rewiew, review list includes

	- conclusion from the entry lists

	- experimental findings

	- insights: from my experiments or others experience

	- code progress (what did I implement)

## switch problems

My personal lesson: do not focus on too many projects at the same time. Two is enough for students. You should focus on one important problem and consistently work on that.

## personal development

- you should allocate some time towards improving your general knowledge of ML as opposed to working on your current project

- main way to build knowledge of ML are to 

	- (foundational knowledge) textbooks: numerical optimization (nocedal, wright), elements of information theory (cover, thomas)
	
	- (foundational knowledge) PhD theses: read (1) _introductory and background materials_ and (3) _conclusions and outlook_. Read section (2) _several published papers_ directly in papers (old theses contain valuable insights, new theses review the literatures in an active field)

	- (frontiers) papers: 

	- reimplement the algorithm from these sources

- How to do it?

	- split time evenly between textbooks and papers to have a good foundation; 

	- reimplementing ideas from papers to gain a knowledge of how state-of-the-art works;

	- keep an eye on the new techniques and skim the less exceptional papers in your field
